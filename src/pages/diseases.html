          <h1>Fungal diseases of grape</h1>

          <p>
            Grapes are one of the most popular country crops. It is grown by
            both professionals and amateurs. When cultivating grapes, it is
            important to recognize various diseases in time and neutralize
            pests. You will learn how to do this correctly from this article. If
            grapes are exposed to any disease or insect, it always affects their
            appearance. Both individual parts of the plant and the entire
            culture as a whole can suffer.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            Grape inflorescences are infrequently affected, so they remain
            untouched in most cases. But a few modifications can still happen.
            For example, a white, felt-like coating will tell you about the
            presence of a grape mite. A powdery coating similar to flour is the
            result of mildew exposure.
          </p>
          <p>Preventive measures:</p>
          <li>weeding and loosening the soil under bushes;</li>
          <li>timely watering of plants;</li>
          <li>cleaning of fallen leaves;</li>
          <li>spray with antibacterial drugs 3-5 times a season.</li>
          <br />
          <p>
            If grapes are grown in an unsuitable region or climate, receive less
            care and care, then they will often be affected by various types of
            diseases. Let's look at what gardeners have to deal with.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Oidium (Oidium Tuckeri Berk)</h2>
          <p>
            Oidium is a common disease of grapes, also called powdery mildew of
            grapes, ash, etc. It covers all vegetative organs of the grape bush
            with a gray powdery coating on top. The leaves and inflorescences
            affected by oidium wither, and the berries first crack, then dry up.
            It is caused by parasitic fungi of the genus Uncinula of the
            ascomycetes department.
          </p>
          <p>
            Important! Absolutely all grape varieties are affected by oidium to
            a greater or lesser extent, even rootstocks. There are no absolutely
            oidium-resistant varieties that do not require spraying. The
            causative agent of oidium affects all the green organs of the vine –
            leaves, shoots, inflorescences, berries, ridges. The pathogen
            overwinters in the kidneys and on the affected shoots. The pathogen
            fungus lives on the surface of the host plant. The fungus appears
            mostly in moderately warm and wet weather, but can also spread
            rapidly during periods of high pressure. Primary infection occurs in
            the 1-3 leaf phase and before flowering (May-June).

          <h2>Botrytis cinerea</h2>
          <p>
            The fungus Botrytis cinerea attacks grape berries – and sometimes
            other parts of the vine – in high humidity conditions. It can
            develop into a destructive gray rot, but with a successful
            combination of circumstances it develops as a desirable botrytis,
            affecting the berries with the so-called "noble rot". Many of the
            great sweet wines of the planet are made from brown, wrinkled,
            "botrytized" berries covered with fluffy mold:

            />

              class="image"

            />
          </span>
          <p>
            During the ripening period, a dangerous fungal disease appears on
            the grapes — gray rot. The disease spreads to young shoots, buds,
            and leaves. But gray rot is especially dangerous for grape brushes.
            Fungal spores actively develop in wet rainy weather in
            August–September and threaten the entire crop on the bush.
